# Overview

# Lessons Learned

Size doen't matter: the smallest bugs cause the biggest headache. You can spend hours combing through your code
only to find is was a simple spelling error, the wrong method name, or an unflushed toilet(scanner). Honestly I 
bigger bugs are easier to fix because they are easier to see. 

Spelling: I've never been good at spelling, I never thought I needed in the real world because who the hell cares about 
grammar? If I could tell my younger self one thing it would be to learn how to spell better, so it could save me some time 
debugging. 

Naming: the naming of my variables have improved(at least I think so) which has made it a 100 times easier to understand
where things are suppose to go in the code and has help me finish our apps faster, but I'm still having difficulty with 
how other people process their code.

Other peoples code: Though I can read and understand other's code I still have a hard time understanding the logic behind
why their code works. I definitely think I'll improve in this area the more exposure I get to code I didn't write, but it's
a struggle for me write now. the more starter code I have the more I find myself having a more difficult time trying to mash my thought process with someone else's. It feels like coming into a movie half way and trying to figure out the plot as well as the
characters motivations.
